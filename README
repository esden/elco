ELCO stands for Esdens Lisp COmpiler

The project started while trying out the Steps provided in two papers 
by Abdulaziz Ghuloum called "Compilers: Backend to Frontend and Back 
to Front Again" and "An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction"

The tests are mostly translated from sheme examples provided on 
Abdulazizs site http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~aghuloum. 

Otherwise you can see in the tags directory of the svn tree all the 
steps from "Compilers: Backend to Frontend"

The syntax of the ELCO language is not stable and will probably change
before I consider it stable. Furthermore see project homepage on 
http://elco.sourceforge.net.

You need asdf to run elco.

Loading the compiler:

(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'elco)

Loading test system:

(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'elco-test)

Running all tests in the console:

utils/run-tests.sh

Running all tests in lisp:

(elco-test:run-tests)

Running a specific testsuite:

(elco-test:run-tests :select "test suite name")

Compiling a program:

(elco:compile-program '(elco:fx+ 1 2))

[NOTE: this only generates the elco.s file in the current working 
       directory of your lisp world]

Compiling and executing a program:

(elco:execute-program '(elco:fx+ 1 2))

The syntax of the ELCO langage can be seen in elco-package.lisp 
export section. Full documentation is pending. But currently because 
the langauge is not stable enough, there is no sense in writing it.
